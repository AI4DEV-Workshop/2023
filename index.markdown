While scientific software is an important component in the pursuit of scientific discovery, software development in HPC continues to be challenging. The software development process today combines contributions from domain scientists, applied mathematicians, computer scientists, and involves complex programming models. As a result of these diverse contributions software environments have become significantly complicated.

With this increasing diversity, the complexity of software development increases and it requires a steep learning curve for new developers, resulting in a slower pace of software development. With the continuous integration of scientific applications in complex, deep software stacks (workflows, compilers, runtime libraries, heterogeneous systems) novel techniques and practical tools for assisting the software development in HPC are invaluable. Recent advances in generative AI and large language models, such as GitHub’s Copilot and OpenAI’s GPT, demonstrate interesting potential for developer assistance and automated code synthesis.

The goal of the AI Assisted Software Development for HPC (AI4DEV) workshop is to create a forum composed of researchers, scientists, application developers, computing center staff, and industry staff to discuss ideas on how artificial intelligence can help in the whole development process. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in the area.


## <a class="anchor" name="topics">Workshop Topics</a>

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Machine learning techniques to improve programming productivity
* Performance analysis driven by AI and ML
* Debugging and testing driven by ML/AI
* ML-assisted compiler optimizations and code generation
* Auto-tuning and performance portability using ML/AI
* Code synthesis and generation using automated ML techniques
* AI-assisted code recommendations for code maintainability, performance, and correctness
* IDE extensions using ML for improved programming productivity
* AI-assisted software building and deployment
* Mining best programming practices using ML

## <a class="anchor" name="submissions"> Submissions and Format </a>

Authors are invited to submit **full papers** or **short papers** in English structured as technical or experience papers. Full papers should have at least **6 pages** but should not exceed **8 pages** of content, including everything except references. Short papers should have at least **3 pages** but should not exceed **4 pages** including everything (references, figures, etc.). Submissions must use the [ACM format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Latex users should use the latest template version 1.90 (last update April 4, 2023) with the “sigconf” option.

Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by the Program Committee and accepted papers will be published by IEEE Xplore.

Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other venue. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. At least one author of an accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Authors may contact the workshop organizers for more information. Papers should be submitted electronically at: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/).

### SC Reproducibility Initiative

We encourage authors to submit an **optional** artifact description (AD) appendix along with their paper, describing the details of their software environments and computational experiments to the extent that an independent person could replicate their results. The AD appendix is not included in the 8-page limit of the paper and should not exceed **2 pages** of content. For more details of the **SC Reproducibility Initiative** please see: [https://sc23.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/]([https://sc22.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/)).
