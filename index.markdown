Software is an increasingly important component in the pursuit of scientific discovery. Both its development and use are essential activities for many scientific teams. Computational science teams have diversified over time to include contributions from domain scientists who provide expertise in scientific and engineering disciplines, applied mathematicians and computer scientists who provide optimal algorithms and data structures, and software and data engineers who provide methodologies and tools adapted and adopted from other software domains. These diverse contributions have enabled tremendous advances in the pursuit of scientific discovery, even as models, computer architectures, and software environments have become more complicated.

With this increasing diversity, the complexity of software development increases and thus it requires a steep learning curve for new developers. Resulting into a slower pace of software development innovations. With the continuous integration of scientific applications in complex, deep software stacks (workflows, compilers, runtime libraries, heterogeneous systems) novel techniques and practical tools for assisting the software development in HPC are invaluable. 

The goal of the AI Assisted Software Development for HPC (AI4DEV) workshop is to create a forum composed of researchers, scientists, application developers, computing center staff and management and computing industry staff to discuss ideas on how artificial intelligence can help in the whole development process. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in the area.

### <a class="anchor" name="submissions"> Submissions and Format </a>

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in English structured as technical or experience papers at a length of at least **6 pages** but not exceeding **8 pages** of content, including everything except references. Submissions must use the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by the Program Committee and accepted papers will be published by IEEE Xplore.

Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other venue. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. At least one author of an accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Authors may contact the workshop organizers for more information. Papers should be submitted electronically at: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/).

#### SC Reproducibility Initiative

We encourage authors to submit an **optional** artifact description (AD) appendix along with their paper, describing the details of their software environments and computational experiments to the extent that an independent person could replicate their results. The AD appendix is not included in the 8-page limit of the paper and should not exceed **2 pages** of content. For more details of the **SC Reproducibility Initiative** please see: [https://sc23.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/]([https://sc22.supercomputing.org/submit/reproducibility-initiative/](https://sc23.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/)).
